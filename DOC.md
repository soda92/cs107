# about unused include

if you see "unused-include" warning for clangd in the current project directory, create a .clangd file with the following contents:
```
Diagnostics:
  UnusedIncludes: None
```


in case it still exists, check `$Env:LocalAppData\clangd\config.yaml`; a case can be:
```
# This file was generated by Qt Creator and will be overwritten unless you remove this line.
Hover:
  ShowAKA: Yes
Diagnostics:
  UnusedIncludes: None
```
